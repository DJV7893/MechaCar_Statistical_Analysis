# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose:

A few weeks after starting his new role at AutoRUs, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the Data Analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

We will help Jeremy and the Data Analytics team do the following:

   1. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
   2. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
   3. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
   4. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical         analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

From our Linear Regression Model Summary Table below we can observe the following:

   1. Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance are statistically likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the model. Which means that the                   Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance have a significant impact on miles per gallon on the MechaCar prototype. Furthermore Vehicle Weight,                   Spoiler Angle, and All Wheel Drive (AWD) have p-values that demonstrate a random amount of variance in the dataset.
   2. The p-value for our model, 5.35e-11, is notably smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. This implies that there is sufficient                 evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which further proves that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
   3. The linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model.             Accordingly, our multiple regression model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
